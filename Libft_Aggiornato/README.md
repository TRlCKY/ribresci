# Libft

## Description
Libft is a custom C library developed as part of the 42 curriculum.  
Its purpose is to reimplement essential functions from the standard C library and extend them with additional utilities for string manipulation, memory management, and linked list operations.  

The goal of the project is to:
- Strengthen understanding of low-level programming concepts.
- Practice modular code design and reusability.
- Provide a foundation library that can be reused in future 42 projects.

## Instructions
Clone the repository and build the library:

git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-repo>
make

### Resources
The "man" command was used extensively to consult official documentation for standard C functions  to ensure correct reimplementation.”
